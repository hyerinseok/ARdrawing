QTM-Unity-VR is the main code for drawing in AR

3. Build and Run APK file on to your Android device.
4. Hold your phone with top of phone to your left, and bottom to right(Landscape-left orientation).
5. Start the app.
6. When the app is fully loaded, slide it into the Lenovo Mirage sleeve, and carefully slide the sleeve into the HMD.
7. Press the trigger of the pen tool to draw
